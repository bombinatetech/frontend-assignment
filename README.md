# Front End Assignment

Ever thought that animals don't have Tinder? I say they need one!

### PurrWoof:
	
You are expected to make a tinder clone for our beloved pets. <br>

It should:
  - Have a stream of dog<sup>1</sup>/cat<sup>2</sup> profiles, depending on the toggle
  - Populate the description with random names<sup>3</sup>
  - Like/pass when the pet clicks on the right/left side of the image (show notification<sup>4</sup> showing liked or passed)
  - Mock a match (every 1 minute) of the same animal type (pick up a random image for the matched pet)
  - Show matches in a modal/pop-up
  - Animate liking/passing (nothing fancy, but it should indicate direction)

It doesn't need any profiles, authentication or any persistent stuff. <br>

Bonus points if its responsive
Bonus points if the website you built is close to the reference. (You can use your own assets)
